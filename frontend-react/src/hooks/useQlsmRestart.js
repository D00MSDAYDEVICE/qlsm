/**
 * State and action behind every "restart QLSM" control.
 *
 * Restarting is what makes a freshly installed addon real: addons register
 * during create_app(), and Flask cannot hot-add a blueprint to a live app.
 *
 * `supported` is false where a restart would not be survivable. A dev run
 * started by run-dev.sh has nothing to bring the process back, so
 * /api/system/info reports restart_supported: false and callers must stay
 * informational rather than offer an action that would end qlsm.
 *
 * On success the page is reloaded rather than refetched: every context in the
 * app was populated by the process that just went away, so a clean reload is
 * both simpler and more honest than patching pieces of state.
